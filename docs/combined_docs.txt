AI models and business scenarios
In this article
In AI Builder, you can choose from several model types that are suited to different business scenarios. Here are some examples:
If you want to use intelligence to detect your products in images, you can refine acustomAI Builder object detection model. With a customizable model, you build, train, and publish it for your intended use.
If you want to use intelligence to automate your expense reports by scanning and processing business receipts, you can use aprebuiltAI Builder receipt scanning model. All prebuilt models allow you to go straight to productivity.
If you want to design a marketing campaign based on patterns in your historical data, you can use acustomprediction model tailored to your business, using your own historical data.
These models are only a few of the ways you can use AI Builder to add intelligence to your business processes.
To build a model with AI Builder:
Sign in toPower AppsorPower Automate.
On the left pane, select... More>AI hub.
SelectAI models.
(Optional)To keepAI modelspermanently on the menu for easy access, select the pin icon.
On the right pane, select the model type that matches what you want to do. You're ready to get started.

Model types
The following table lists the data type, models type, and build type.
Data type: Describes the type of AI that the models use (for example, documents, text, structured data, or images).
Build type: Indicates whether it's a customizable model that you need to build, train, and publish for your intended use, or if it's a prebuilt model that's ready to use. In general, usecustomAI Builder models for applications where you're working with data that's unique to your business. Useprebuiltmodels for scenarios that are common across different types of businesses.
Common business scenariosand the model types that are suited to them are described later in this article.

Comparing business models: Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon & Facebook
All five tech giants have similar business model building blocks, but the importance of each block varies in each model. We break it down for you in a first rough conceptual prototype.

The table above that Iâve put together was triggered by this great visual put together by Visual Capitalist (scroll down to the bottom of this post to see the image). The image by Visual Capitalist does a great job of comparing the major revenues. I thoughtÂ it could be interesting to break that comparison down even further beyond the revenue element of each companyâs business model.When you look at the prototype table above you see how all five companies have very similar building blocks, but the importance of each one of those building blocks vary in each business model. This is a very rough comparison; and if I had taken more time, Iâd have drawn up and compared Business Model Canvases for each company. And if you attend ourmaster workshopsor take anonline course, youâll see that weâve analyzed some of the above business models in more detail (e.g. the evolution of Appleâs business model over time).This is a work-in-progress, and I welcome your feedback or comments to help progress this analysis. Click through to the spreadsheet andleave me your thoughts directly in the document.
